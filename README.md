# sql-server-database-scripts
Microsoft SQL Server Database scripts that let us all rest at night
============================================================

This is just an open, Internet-centric repository of all the SQL scripts I've been both developing and finding through the years as an Microsoft SQL Server's DBA.

Parallel projects will be Oracle RDBMS Server and Sybase ASE scripts.

Collaborations allowed, of course.
