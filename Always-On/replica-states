# To find out the currewnt Sync State on each AG Database:

SELECT
Groups.[Name] AS AGname,
AGDatabases.database_name AS Databasename,
States.synchronization_health AS DBstate
FROM sys.dm_hadr_availability_group_states States
INNER JOIN master.sys.availability_groups Groups ON States.group_id = Groups.group_id
INNER JOIN sys.availability_databases_cluster AGDatabases ON Groups.group_id = AGDatabases.group_id
WHERE primary_replica = @@Servername
ORDER BY
AGname ASC,
Databasename ASC;

# The expected result should be:

AGname	Databasename	DBstate
SP3SQLProdAG	PRDINVBilling	2
SP3SQLProdAG	PRDINVBrazilDaily	2
SP3SQLProdAG	PRDINVBrazilHistory	2
SP3SQLProdAG	PRDINVLatamDaily	2
SP3SQLProdAG	PRDINVLatamHistory	2

# Where synchronization_health (DBstate) implies the intersection of the synchronization state of a database that is joined to the 
availability group on the availability replica and the availability mode of the availability replica (synchronous-commit or
asynchronous-commit mode), one of the following values.

0 = Not healthy. The synchronization_state of the database is 0 (NOT SYNCHRONIZING).

1 = Partially healthy. A database on a synchronous-commit availability replica is considered partially healthy if synchronization_state is 1 (SYNCHRONIZING).

2 = Healthy. A database on an synchronous-commit availability replica is considered healthy if synchronization_state is 2 (SYNCHRONIZED), and a database on an asynchronous-commit availability replica is considered healthy if synchronization_state is 1 (SYNCHRONIZING).
