# Index fragmentation can be found by querying the built in sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats DMV. 
# To get readable, useful information youâ€™ll also need to join your query to other DMVs such as sys.indexes and sys.tables.  
# Below is a simple query that will provide a list of indexes, fragmentation percentage, and record counts for each table in a 
# database.
